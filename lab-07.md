```

### Exercise 1

This plot oversimplified the concept of wear mask, and other situations,
like quarantine policy, health baseline. The original visualization
somehow have dual Y-Axis Scaling, making direct comparisons difficult.
Based on this plot, it seems like mask mandates lead to higher cases
initially.

3 columns, and 31 rows; this dataset shows an increase in mask-wearing
and a decrease in COVID-19 cases-in general- over time.

### Exercise 2

``` r
covid_data <- covid_data %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
 
ggplot(covid_data, aes(x = date, y = covid_cases, color = counties, group = counties)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Mask" = "lightblue", "No Mask" = "pink")) +  
  labs( title = "COVID-19 Cases Over Time in Mask vs. No Mask Counties",
    x = "Date",
    y = "COVID-19 Cases Per 100K Population",
    color = "County Type"
  )
```

<!-- {r more clear visz} -->

my plot show a clear decrease trend for mask wearing; and a increase
trend for no mask counties. and we can clearly see how wearing mask
vs. not wearing mask affect covid cases. and my plot labeled mask vs no
mask with different color, it’s more clear than the original plot.

<!-- {r useful information} -->

What, if any, useful information do these data and your visualization
tell us about mask wearing and COVID? It’ll be difficult to set aside
what you already know about mask wearing, but you should try to focus
only on what this visualization tells. Feel free to also comment on
whether that lines up with what you know about mask wearing.

so only based on my visualization, it seems like wearing mask reduces
the rate of covid, but it takes time to see this effect; whereas without
a mask, the effect is less pronounced initially, but as time goes on,
the rate of covid increases. And while wearing a mask will slow down the
chances of getting the covid, it’s not a complete elimination. There are
still cases of covid in both masked and non-masked areas.

<!-- {r misleading visz} -->

the easier way would be change the Y-axis to make it seems like the
cases increased in mask-wearing counties. and change the color, to
attract the attention.

``` r
ggplot(covid_data, aes(x = date, y = covid_cases, color = counties, group = counties)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Mask" = "pink", "No Mask" = "blue")) +  
  scale_y_reverse() + 
  labs( title = "COVID-19 Cases Over Time in Mask vs. No Mask Counties",
    subtitle = "just kidding",
    x = "Date",
    y = "COVID-19 Cases Per 100K Population",
    color = "County Type"
  )
```

the key factors that contribute to this message, such as the variables
used, the scale of the axes, and the type of visualization.

the variables we have are the: date (X-axis), which allowing a clear
view of trends over time; and covid_cases (Y-axis) which is the measure
of the infection rate; and counties shows the COVID-19 cases per 100K
population, which is the primary measure of infection rate; and counties
(colored as “Mask” Vs. “No Mask”) given a easy comparison between two
groups.

I use a Line Graph, because this graph shows trends over time.

In my opposite visualization, I flipped the Y-axis to make it look like
the COVID cases in counties without masks were progressively decreasing.
The misleading message I was trying to convey was that the masks had no
effect and even increased COVID-19 cases.
